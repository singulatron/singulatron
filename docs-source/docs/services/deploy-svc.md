# Deploy Svc

The deploy service is responsible of launching containers on whatever infrastructure the Superplatform is running on (eg. [Docker Svc](/docs/services/docker-svc)) and registering them into the [Registry Svc](/docs/services/docker-svc).

It registers services it launches since services are not expected to self register. This is to support services that are not using the Superplatform SDK to build themselvesâ€”in other words, Superplatform is designed to be able to run non-Superplatform services too.

> This page is a high level overview of the `Deploy Svc`. For more details, please see the [Deploy Svc API documentation](/docs/superplatform/save-deployment).

## Dependencies
